# Components structure

All components should be inside a folder which includes de component and the storybook file

Components are divided in:

- [Atoms](#atoms)
- [Molecules](#molecules)
- [Organisms](#organisms)
- [Layout](#layout)

## Atoms

> [Go to Docs](?path=/docs/components-atoms-docs--docs)

Should be small components with as few dependencies as possible, should be divided by folders which include the component itself and the corresponding storybook, **small abstractions of the components can be inside the same folder**.

## Molecules

> [Go to Docs](?path=/docs/components-molecules-docs--docs)

Should be composed by atoms or medium sized components, should be divided by folders which include the component itself and the corresponding storybook, **Should not have abstractions in the same folder**.

## Organisms

> [Go to Docs](?path=/docs/components-organisms-docs--docs)
> Large components that can be composed by molecules or atoms, should be divided by folders which include the component itself and the corresponding storybook, **Should not have abstractions in the same folder**.

## Layout

Components meant to wrap the application.

- [Navbar](?path=/story/layout-navbar--default-navbar)
- [Layout](?path=/story/layout-layout--default)
- [Footer](?path=/story/layout-footer--default)
- Misc
  - [NotFound](?path=/story/layout-notfound--default)
